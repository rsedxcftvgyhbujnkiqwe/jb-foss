A free and open source jailbreak map developed by blank and gusic

## Things to know
While not required, this map was created using the following. You can edit it using whatever you'd like, just note potential compatability issues may be present if you do.
- Hammer++
- Spud FGD

## Goals
This map is intended to be a completely open source map that can be used by others to create maps on top of. Inspired by the counterstrike electric razor jailbreak map, this map will have a base layout with the games being instances, allowing for mixing and matching. Additionally, by creating a standard for game dimensions, it will be very easy to move games, and create template games that others can use in versions of the map.

Additionally, this map serves as a proof of concept for a cooperative mapping style. By using the instance feature, we can work on games individually without stepping on eachother's toes, allowing changes to be pushed without having the map be all in one file.
